## Brief Summary

[Cross origin resource sharing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cross-origin_resource_sharing) (CORS) is a mechanism that enables a web browser to perform cross-domain requests using the XMLHttpRequest L2 API in a controlled manner. In the past, the XMLHttpRequest L1 API only allowed requests to be sent within the same origin as it was restricted by the same origin policy.
