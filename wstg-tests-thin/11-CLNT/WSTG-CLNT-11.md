## Brief Summary

Web Messaging (also known as [Cross Document Messaging](https://html.spec.whatwg.org/multipage/web-messaging.html#web-messaging)) allows applications running on different domains to communicate in a secure manner. Before the introduction of web messaging, the communication of different origins (between iframes, tabs and windows) was restricted by the same origin policy and enforced by the browser.
