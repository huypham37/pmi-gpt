## Brief Summary

This section describes how to check for client-side URL redirection, also known as open redirection. It is an input validation flaw that exists when an application accepts user-controlled input that specifies a link which leads to an external URL that could be malicious. This kind of vulnerability could be used to accomplish a phishing attack or redirect a victim to an infection page.
