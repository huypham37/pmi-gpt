## Brief Summary

Cross Site Script Inclusion (XSSI) vulnerability allows sensitive data leakage across-origin or cross-domain boundaries. Sensitive data could include authentication-related data (login states, cookies, auth tokens, session IDs, etc.) or user's personal or sensitive personal data (email addresses, phone numbers, credit card details, social security numbers, etc.).
