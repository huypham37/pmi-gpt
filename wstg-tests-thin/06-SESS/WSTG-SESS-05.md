## Brief Summary

Cross-Site Request Forgery ([CSRF](https://owasp.org/www-community/attacks/csrf)) is an attack that forces an end user to execute unintended actions on a web application in which they are currently authenticated. With a little social engineering help (like sending a link via email or chat), an attacker may force the users of a web application to execute actions of the attacker's choosing.
