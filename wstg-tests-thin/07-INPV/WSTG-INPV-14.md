## Brief Summary

The Lightweight Directory Access Protocol (LDAP) is used to store information about users, hosts, and many other objects. [LDAP injection](https://wiki.owasp.org/index.php/LDAP_injection) is a server-side attack, which could allow sensitive information about users and hosts represented in an LDAP structure to be disclosed, modified, or inserted.
