## Brief Summary

[Object Relational Mapping (ORM) Injection](https://capec.mitre.org/data/definitions/109.html) is an attack using SQL Injection against an ORM generated data access object model. From the point of view of a tester, this attack is virtually identical to a SQL Injection attack. However, the injection vulnerability exists in code generated by the ORM layer.
