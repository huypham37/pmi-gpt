## Brief Summary

Reflected [Cross-site Scripting (XSS)](https://owasp.org/www-community/attacks/xss/) occur when an attacker injects browser executable code within a single HTTP response. The injected attack is not stored within the application itself; it is non-persistent and only impacts users who open a maliciously crafted link or third-party web page.
