## Brief Summary

Cloud storage services facilitate web application and services to store and access objects in the storage service. Improper access control configuration, however, may result in sensitive information exposure, data being tampered, or unauthorized access. A known example is where an Amazon S3 bucket is misconfigured, although the other cloud storage services may also be exposed to similar risks.
