## Brief Summary

When information is sent between the client and the server, it must be encrypted and protected in order to prevent an attacker from being able to read or modify it. This is most commonly done using HTTPS, which uses the [Transport Layer Security (TLS)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transport_Layer_Security) protocol, a replacement for the older Secure Socket Layer (SSL) protocol.
