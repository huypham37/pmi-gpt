# ACTIVE MEMORY: Issue #25
## Link
https://github.com/huypham37/pmi-gpt/issues/25

## Context & Goal
When a user triggers test case generation, the RAG step that selects relevant WSTG entries fails silently if no model is currently loaded in LMStudio.

### Current Behavior
- LMStudio returns `{"title":"No model found that fits the query."}`
- Generation completes with 0 test cases and no visible error shown to the user

### Expected Behavior
- Auto-load a default/configured LMStudio model if none is active, OR
- Show a clear error to the user prompting them to load a model in LMStudio before generating
- **The application must not fail silently** — errors must surface via UI error message

## Plan
- [ ] Setup Worktree and Environment
- [ ] Investigate LMStudio model check logic in `apps/electron/src/main/`
- [ ] Add model availability check before RAG/generation step
- [ ] Surface error to UI when no model is loaded (clear, actionable message)
- [ ] Test: open LMStudio with no model loaded → trigger generation → verify error shown

## Progress Log
### [2026-02-19] Initialization
- Issue #25 already existed on GitHub.
- Worktree spawned from main branch.
