# ACTIVE MEMORY: Issue #30
## Link
https://github.com/huypham37/pmi-gpt/issues/30

## Context & Goal
Add a delete button to the test cases UI so users can remove individual test cases.

## Plan
- [ ] Setup branch and environment
- [ ] Locate delete/remove atom in `apps/electron/src/renderer/atoms/testcases.ts` (removeTestCase atom likely already exists)
- [ ] Add a delete button to `TestCaseCard.tsx` (trash icon, visible on hover or always shown)
- [ ] Wire delete button to the remove atom and any IPC call needed to persist deletion (`window.electronAPI.*`)
- [ ] Confirm deletion in `TestCaseGrid.tsx` re-renders correctly after removal
- [ ] Test manually: add test cases, delete one, verify it is gone from grid and persisted state

## Key Files
- `apps/electron/src/renderer/components/testcases/TestCaseCard.tsx` — primary UI change (add delete button)
- `apps/electron/src/renderer/atoms/testcases.ts` — state management (removeTestCase atom)
- `apps/electron/src/renderer/components/testcases/TestCaseGrid.tsx` — grid that maps IDs → cards
- `apps/electron/src/renderer/pages/TestCaseGeneratorPage.tsx` — page-level orchestration

## Progress Log
