# ACTIVE MEMORY: Issue #31
## Link
https://github.com/huypham37/pmi-gpt/issues/31

## Context & Goal
**Priority: High**

When a user uploads a markdown file in the test cases (project context), there is no detection to determine whether the file needs to go through Docling. Plain `.md` files can be read directly; other formats (PDF, DOCX, images, etc.) must go through Docling. Currently the flow treats all uploads the same way.

## Plan
- [ ] Setup branch and environment
- [ ] Review `addProjectContextDocument` IPC handler in main process to understand current ingestion flow
- [ ] Review `apps/electron/src/main/lib/docling-extract.ts` — `DOCLING_EXTS` already defines which extensions need Docling
- [ ] Add detection logic: if file extension is `.md` or `.txt`, skip Docling and read directly; otherwise route through `extractWithDocling()`
- [ ] Update `ProjectContextPanel.tsx` to accept `.md` files in `SUPPORTED_EXTS` (currently missing)
- [ ] Update `TestCasesNavigatorPanel.tsx` similarly if needed
- [ ] Test with a plain `.md` upload (should bypass Docling) and a `.pdf` upload (should still go through Docling)

## Key Files
- `apps/electron/src/main/lib/docling-extract.ts` — `DOCLING_EXTS`, `extractWithDocling()` — detection logic goes here
- `apps/electron/src/renderer/components/testcases/ProjectContextPanel.tsx` — file upload UI (add `.md` to accepted extensions)
- `apps/electron/src/renderer/components/testcases/TestCasesNavigatorPanel.tsx` — secondary upload UI
- Main IPC handler for `addProjectContextDocument` (locate in `apps/electron/src/main/ipc.ts` or similar) — where routing decision is made

## Technical Notes
- `DOCLING_EXTS` in `docling-extract.ts` lists formats that require Docling (`pdf`, `docx`, `pptx`, `xlsx`, `html`, images)
- `.md` files are plain text — no Docling needed, just `fs.readFile`
- Detection logic: `if (DOCLING_EXTS.includes(ext)) { extractWithDocling(path) } else { fs.readFile(path) }`
